# Snag a file proposal

Problems: currently our internet service providers give us high speed internet up to 1gb, 
and this is great but the issue is that when we download files a lot of the time we dont properly make use of all the bandwith we have 
avaible.
Solution: Snag a file makes use of concureny to download faster. by splitting up a file and downloading smaller sections on
individal thread we are able to download the file at increadible speeds!
